# Sanskrit-Teacher


Note: My old repository wasn't working so I just had created a new one.

This program quizzes users on the Sanskrit Vowels written with the Devanagari script.

As stated on the project itself, I made this program due to wanting to something to teach me the Sanskrit alphabet. I thought it would be effective doing online flashcards and the learn mode given on websites but soon enough I found myself stuck behind a paywall. I wanted to make this program to not only teach myself but others as well who are in my situation simply for free.

If this works out, I will keep adding more, my goal is to be able to use this to self teach or teach others Intermediate Sanskrit from scratch, through different modes that I will implement other than just quizzes.

1. Make sure to install a Devanagari script keyboard layout and familiarizing how it works and make sure to have the font installed as well
